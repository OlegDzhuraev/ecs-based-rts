# ECS-based RTS on Unity
RTS game example based on **Entity Component System** in Unity game engine.

## Purpose of this project
It was hard for me to find anything seriously or big project on GitHub based on ECS. So I decided to create this one and show more complicated game than endless snakes and pac mans. Seriusly, guys, ECS community should stop creating mobile one-mechanic prototypes as examples of **Entity Component System** :)

## Requirements
**Unity version:** 2020.1<br>
**ECS Framework:** [LeoECS](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) by [Leopotam](mailto:leopotam@gmail.com)

## Future updates
This project is made for fun, not for something serious, so I can't guarantee that I will update it oftently. :)
